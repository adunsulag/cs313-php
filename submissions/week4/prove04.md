After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Provide a link to your myDb.sql file at GitHub (the file that contains all the SQL commands needed to create your database).
https://github.com/adunsulag/cs313-php/blob/master/db/create-schema.sql


2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.
I was pleased with how the activity log came together with all of the other tables as the triggers populated the data nicely.


3. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.
I think some of the triggers could be more refined to include specific columns that changed.


4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I learned how to build triggers in postgress as well as how to deal with session variables from the postgress.  The triggers were cool as I've never
really done much with them before outside of seen other db applications use them.


5. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.
A database should strive to normalize data so that each record that is stored is unique and not duplicated.
A database should use constraints, including foreign key constraints, to maintain the integrity of the data.


6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

E.

7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I went above and beyond the assignment of creating tables and foreign keys to actually building out triggers and writing extensive tests around those triggers
to make sure the data and tables are operating properly.
