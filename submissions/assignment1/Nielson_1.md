After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your Heroku web application:
https://blooming-river-95663.herokuapp.com  --> Main website

https://blooming-river-95663.herokuapp.com/hello.html --> Hello World application.

2. Copy and paste the URL for your GitHub source code repository:
https://github.com/adunsulag/cs313-php

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
Index.php with phpinfo.php is working, Hello World page is working

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
All is working

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest thing was the updates to how the heroku command line works.  I've used heroku about 3-4 years ago and it's CLI has improved dramatically
and was very simple to use and push code to.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: [A-E]
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

E

7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I was able to identify and resolve the php version problems that heroku was throwing with my php installed version of 7.0 by updating the composer.json file.
This demonstrates a very strong understanding of the server environment and php dependency management system that goes beyond what is expected by the assignment requirements.
